## Description

Building this site from the ground up was a big undertaking for me, but I learned so much through the process. I Googled a bunch, worked with other classmates, learned how to "Ask BCS" and keep trying things out. I know this website will change a lot over time but I feel like I have the framework/ backbone to continue to add to it as we continue to make new projects. I am actually excited to see it evolve overtime. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This will be a working website for me to continue to add to and update throughout this course. The idea is for this to be my professional Portfolio to give to future employers to showcase my work.
