            ALL ABOUT ME
                <ul>After completing my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Recreation Management and Youth Leadership, I chose to raise a family. While absent from the workforce, I used my knowledge, skills and experiences in a number of volunteer capacities; such as teaching children and youth, leading a cub scout den and coordinating compassionate service opportunities with members of my congregation to ensure struggling families had needs met.
                </ul>
                <ul>Over an 8 year period, I grew and managed a personal business as an independent sales consultant for Norwex. Through these opportunities, I learned how to interact and work well with a diverse group of people with varying needs. In addition, I cultivated my ability for organization and refined collaboration strategies to help others achieve short and long-term financial goals. This included working hard toward a professional goal and earning an all-inclusive trip to Cancun in October 2021.
                </ul>
                <ul>Recently, I have worked as an office manager for a property management company. In my time there I put together Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that could be utilized for future training to make sure that future training would be done with all required steps. I took the initiative to strategically organize all the paperwork with every property ensuring that every property manager was storing docs in the same manner for ease in accessing tenant records.</ul>
                <ul>I am an avid learner and I adapt to new challenges quickly. This Coding Bootcamp is the next chapter in my story.
